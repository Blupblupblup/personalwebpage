## About Me

I'm currently a Data Scientist working on computational pathology at [Aignostics](https://www.aignostics.com/) in Berlin. As such, I mostly develop machine learning models and pipelines to run segmentation and classification on whole slide images depicting human tissue with immune cells and cancer.

Before that I was a PhD student in machine learning at [Mines Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_ParisTech) (part of [PSL University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Sciences_et_Lettres_University)) and [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Group). This research was financed by a [*Cifre-DÃ©fense* grant](https://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/cifre-defense-24859).

## Research Interest

My current work applies machine learning to histopathology images.

I'm interested in anomaly detection, also called out-of-distribution detection or one-class classification, and representation learning for signal (Radio, Audio, EEG, ECG) and image processing (satellite, medical).

## Misc

I talked about anomaly detection at a Franco-German University [workshop on mathematical image processing](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/fairs_events/2022/2022_05_23_german-french-workshop.html) in May 2022 in Kaiserslautern.

I contributed to the review of a paper for the [ECML PKDD 2022](https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/) conference.

I co-supervised a master degree intern working on multivariate time series discrimination at Thales during the spring and summer of 2021.

I [participated](https://github.com/Blupblupblup/challenge-iclr-2021/tree/main/Blupblupblup) in the ICLR [Computational Geometry & Topology Challenge](https://github.com/geomstats/challenge-iclr-2021) 2021, which resulted in a white [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09810).

I talked about anomaly detection to IASD master program students as part of the [deep learning for image analysis course](http://cours.cmm.mines-paristech.fr/wiki/doku.php/deep/start) during the winter 2020 edition.

I contributed to the review of a paper for the [RADAR 2019](https://www.radar2019.org/) conference.
