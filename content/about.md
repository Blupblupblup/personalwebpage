## About Me

My name is Martin Bauw and I'm currently a PhD student in machine learning at [Mines ParisTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_ParisTech) and [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_Group).

## Research Interest

My research applies machine learning to radar data. I'm especially interested in anomaly detection and machine learning for signal processing.
